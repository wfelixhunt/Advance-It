  ### Project Description
  So, you're working in a music venue and you have a show today but you dont have any of the much needed resources. To the rescue is Show Advancer Pro which allows the venue to send the incoming band to a website to enter the pertinent information needed to run the show. Simply answer a couple questions and provide a couple images and a day sheet is automatically generated. There is also a comments section meant to act as a running conversation between the band and venue, eliminating pesky email chains!
